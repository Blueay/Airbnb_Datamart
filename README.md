# 1. Requirements Specification

## 1.1 Problem Definition and Objective

Airbnb is a global online platform that connects travelers with hosts offering short-term accommodations.
The platform facilitates the entire booking process, including property listing, search and filtering, 
secure payment, and review functionality. To support this, a structured and normalized relational database is required 
that can manage listings, users, bookings, payments, and other associated interactions.

This project aims to develop a conceptual database model that serves as a foundation for a robust data mart. 
The system should capture and relate all essential components of the Airbnb ecosystem while enabling scalability,
accuracy, and efficient query performance.

Guest: Books accommodations, leaves reviews, manages personal profile, sends messages
Host: Lists accommodations, sets availability and prices, responds to guest inquiries
